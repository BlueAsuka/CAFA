A cleaning company located in Edmonton wants to get the best exposure possible for promoting their new x1 without exceeding their $250,000 advertising budget. To do so, the company decides to spend their money on two forms of advertising: (1) x2 and (2) x3. Each x2 costs $5,000; each x3 costs $9,150. The expected exposure, based on industry ratings, is 60,500 viewers for each x2. Additionally, the expected exposure for each x3 is 50,000 viewers.
